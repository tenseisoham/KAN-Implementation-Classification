# KAN-Kolomogorov-Arnold-Networks-Multiclass-Classification-on-Tabular-data-
This repository contains the implementation of the Knowledge Augmented Network (KAN) for multi-class classification on tabular datasets (IRIS). KAN leverages domain knowledge and deep learning to enhance predictive performance, particularly in scenarios where data alone might not capture all nuances.

## Visualizations

### Test Confusion Matrix
This confusion matrix visualizes the model's performance on the test set, showing how well the model predicts each class of the IRIS dataset.
